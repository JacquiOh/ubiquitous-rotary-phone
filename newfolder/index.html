<h1>I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas.</h1>
<p>I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness. Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry?</p>
<p>Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money! Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd. <strong> Stop!</strong> <em> Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe!</em> Cause explosive decompression!</p>
<h2>With gusto.</h2>
<p>I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died. No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself. For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist!</p>
<ol>
<li>Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume?</li><li>Are you crazy? I can't swallow that.</li><li>Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans!</h3>
<p>OK, if everyone's finished being stupid. We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera. Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head. Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hey, whatcha watching?</li><li>That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing.</li><li>The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate.</li>
</ul>

<p>And from now on you're all named Bender Jr. Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd. Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long. You know, I was God once.</p>
<p>It's toe-tappingly tragic! Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew. I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages!</p>
<p>I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness. You wouldn't. Ask anyway! I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in.</p>
<p>Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd. No, I'm Santa Claus! Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious. I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger.</p>
<p>Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' itâ€¦ then perhaps gifts! I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things. I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually?</p>
<p>And from now on you're all named Bender Jr. Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree. I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense.</p>
<p>There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain! I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually?</p>
<p>No, just a regular mistake. Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence. That's not soon enough! Ask her how her day was.</p>
<p>This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry! I can explain. It's very valuable. Why not indeed!</p>
<p>And why did 'I' have to take a cab? Fatal. Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it. But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things.</p>
<p>The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate. Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer. Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy.</p>
